## About me
Pronouns: She/her/hers üë©üèΩ  
Hi! My name is Ariadne Rincon and I am a senior computer science major at CSUF. I am extremely excited to graduate this spring '23, but as of right now I am focusing on learning core concepts, improving my skills, and creating new projects!

## Things I am passionate about
- Coding :computer:
- Making core memories :camera:

## I am currently working on...
- **Ray Tracer Projects**    
  Creating worlds with geometric objects like spheres, triangles, rings, etc.   
  Using this knowledge to render 3D realistic images   
- **Video Game Projects**    
  Created a BlackJack Game from scratch!   
  Working on a loading screen for my new game  
- **Discord Bots**  
  Creating multiple discord bots with unique functionalities to add into your discord servers!  
  More Info:  
    TranslateLanguageBot when finished will help users within a server to translate words or phrases into any language they'd like.  
    This project has given me experience in working with API's (discord and google translate) and learning how to web-scrape.
